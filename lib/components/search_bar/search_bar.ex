defmodule ScenicWidgets.SearchBar do
  @moduledoc """
  A reusable search bar component for Scenic applications.

  Provides a horizontal search bar with:
  - Text input field for search query
  - Previous/Next navigation buttons
  - Match count display (e.g., "3/10")
  - Close button

  ## Usage

      ScenicWidgets.SearchBar.add_to_graph(graph,
        %{
          id: :search_bar,
          frame: %Widgex.Frame{pin: {0, 0}, size: {400, 36}},
          query: "initial search"  # optional
        },
        id: :search_bar
      )

  ## Events Emitted

  The component sends events to its parent via `cast_parent/2`:

  - `{:search_query_changed, id, query}` - when user types in search field
  - `{:search_next, id}` - when clicking next button or pressing Enter
  - `{:search_prev, id}` - when clicking previous button or pressing Shift+Enter
  - `{:search_close, id}` - when clicking close button or pressing Escape
  - `{:replace_mode_requested, id}` - when pressing Ctrl+H while the bar has focus

  ## Updating Match Count

  To update the match count display, send a message to the component:

      Scenic.Scene.put_child(scene, :search_bar, {:set_matches, current, total})

  ## Keyboard Shortcuts

  - `Enter` - Navigate to next match
  - `Shift+Enter` - Navigate to previous match
  - `Escape` - Close the search bar
  - `Backspace` - Delete character before cursor
  - `Delete` - Delete character at cursor
  - `Left/Right` - Move cursor
  - `Home` - Move cursor to start
  - `End` - Move cursor to end
