  Draws `ScenicWidgets.SearchBar`.

  The arrangement is the one every editor has settled on, and for reasons
  worth writing down:

      [⌄] [ Find……………………………… Aa .* ] [‹] [3/10] [›]              [×]
          [ Replace………………………………… ]                     [→] [⇉]

  * The **disclosure caret** is on the far left, where something that opens
    another row belongs — it points at what it opens.
  * The **close** is on the far right. It used to be on the left, in the
    caret's place, which put the most destructive control in the bar under
    the pointer's resting position.
  * The **option toggles** sit inside the right-hand end of the field they
    apply to, so it reads that they modify the query rather than the search.
  * Every button has a tooltip. These are drawn glyphs rather than words, and
    an icon that cannot say what it does has to be guessed at.

  Every rectangle here comes from `State.widgets/1` — the same list the hit
  test uses, so a button cannot draw in one place and respond in another.
