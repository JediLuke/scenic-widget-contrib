defmodule ScenicWidgets.Menu.Dropdown do
  @moduledoc """
  A panel of menu rows, drawn wherever you hang it.

  This was the second half of `ScenicWidgets.IconMenu.Renderer`, reachable
  only by that component — so anything else wanting a menu-shaped popover had
  to write its own, which is exactly what the search pane did. What made it
  un-reusable was never the drawing; it was that every function took the
  BAR's state and read `active_menu` out of it. A panel does not need to know
  it belongs to a bar.

  It takes rows (`ScenicWidgets.Menu.Model` structs, or the old
  `{id, label}` tuples), a `bounds` map saying where the panel goes and where
  each row sits inside it, and a theme. It returns a graph.

      Dropdown.render(graph, rows, bounds,
        theme: theme,
        hovered: hovered_item_id,
        show_shortcuts: true,
        id: :my_panel
      )

  `bounds` is `%{x:, y:, width:, height:, items: %{id => %{y:, height:}}}`,
  which is what `IconMenu.State.calculate_dropdown_bounds/1` already built —
  laid out by the caller, because where a panel can go depends on what it
  hangs off and how much room is under it, and that IS the caller's business.
