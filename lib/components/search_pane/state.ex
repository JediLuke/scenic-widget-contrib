defmodule ScenicWidgets.SearchPane.State do
  @moduledoc """
  Layout and interaction state for `ScenicWidgets.SearchPane`.

  The pane is two regions stacked in one frame:

    * a **header** that does not scroll — the query and replacement
      fields, the `Aa`/`.*` option toggles, Replace All, and a status line;
    * a **body** that does — the SCOPE tree and the results, grouped by file.

  Everything drawable is described here as a rectangle so that one list serves
  drawing, hit testing and semantic registration. `header_widgets/1` returns the
  header's rectangles in frame-local coordinates; `rows/1` returns the body's in
  *content* coordinates (i.e. before the scroll offset is applied), the same
  convention `SideNav` uses for `item_bounds`.

  The three text fields are owned here rather than by the parent. A field whose
  contents arrived from outside on every keystroke would fight the person
  typing into it; the parent is told what changed and does not tell the pane
  what it now holds.
