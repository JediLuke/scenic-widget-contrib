defmodule ScenicWidgets.SearchPane.Renderizer do
  @moduledoc """
  Draws `ScenicWidgets.SearchPane`.

  ## Why this is incremental

  It used to rebuild the whole graph on every change, on the grounds that a
  sidebar's worth of content is small enough not to be worth the bookkeeping.
  That is true right up until the pane wants to contain a **component** — a
  TextField for its query, say — because a graph built from scratch takes the
  component with it, and a child that is destroyed and recreated on every
  keystroke loses its cursor, its selection and its input registration.

  So the pane is drawn as four independent pieces, and a change replaces only
  the pieces it actually affects:

      :search_pane_background   the pane's own rect            (theme/frame)
      :search_pane_chrome       header backdrop, title, close  (theme/frame)
      :search_pane_widgets      fields, toggles, status        (typing, results)
      :search_pane_body         result rows and scrollbars     (results, hover)

  None of the four overlap another, so replacing one and letting it land at
  the end of the graph cannot put it over the top of something it should be
  under. Anything that does not fit that — a change of theme or frame —
  rebuilds the lot, which is rare enough to be free.
