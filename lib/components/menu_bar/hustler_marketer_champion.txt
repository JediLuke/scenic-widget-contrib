Alright team, let's turn this "spacebridge simulator" into the must-have remote team experience for the holidays! Here's our 8-week battle plan:

## Product Rebranding

The beauty of this plan? It's all about making our customers our marketers. When teams have a blast, they'll share it. When HR sees the engagement, they'll book more. And with November timing, we're not selling a game - we're selling the solution to awkward virtual holiday parties.
